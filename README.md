# Narratiwe

Narratiwe it's an open source project created by Danilo Dughetti.
It wants to be a responsive web app for all writing enthusiasts: Anyone can easily write and read fantastic stories. You can choose to write a private story and publish it when ended or to create a shared story that is continued by anyone in the community.

The app is already running on `https://www.narratiwe.com`, let's add new feature and improve this codebase!

## Development server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.3.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Firebase configuration

In order to execute http calling to a backend you will have to create a Firebase application and edit `utils/firebaseconfig.ts` that is leaved blank for privacy reason.
